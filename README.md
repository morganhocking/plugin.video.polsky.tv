plugin.video.polsky.tv
======================

updates to the polish tv plugin for xbmc.  Original work done by eugene bond and hightower.

Known issues:  The icons aren't finished for all of the channels so some channels will show up with 
blank icons- that should be fixed soon.   The vod mode has to be in "use old vod method" to work on most machines.

If using on the firetv, you need to just turn off hardware acceleration for video to work.
